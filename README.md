React Scan detects performance issues in your React app.

Previously, tools like [`<Profiler />`](https://react.dev/reference/react-devtools), [Why Did You Render?](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render), and [React Devtools](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) required lots of manual code change, lacked simple visual cues, or didn't have a simple, programmatic API.

Instead, React Scan automatically detects and highlights renders that cause performance issues. This shows you exactly which components you need to fix.

It's also just JavaScript, so you drop it in anywhere – script tag, npm, you name it!

## Install

Get started in 5 seconds, add this script to your app:

```html
<!-- import this BEFORE any scripts -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-scan/dist/auto.global.js"></script>
```

Examples:

<details>
<summary><b>Next.js (pages)</b></summary>

<br />

Add the script tag to your `pages/_document.tsx`:

```jsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Head>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-scan/dist/auto.global.js"></script>

        {/* rest of your scripts go under */}
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Next.js (app)</b></summary>

<br />

Add the script tag to your `app/layout.tsx`:

```jsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-scan/dist/auto.global.js" async />
        {/* rest of your scripts go under */}
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Vite / Create React App</b></summary>

<br />

Add the script tag to your `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-scan/dist/auto.global.js"></script>

    <!-- rest of your scripts go under -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

---

**_Or_**, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install react-scan
```

Then, in your app, import this **BEFORE** `react`:

```js
import { scan } from 'react-scan'; // import this BEFORE react
import React from 'react';

scan({
  enabled: true,
  log: true, // logs render info to console (default: false)
});
```

## Why React Scan?

React can be tricky to optimize.

The issue is that component props are compared by reference, not value. This is intentional – this way rendering can be cheap to run.

However, this makes it easy to accidentally cause unnecessary renders, making the the app slow. Even in production apps, with hundreds of engineers, can't fully optimize their apps (see [GitHub](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/.github/assets/github.mp4), [Twitter](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/.github/assets/twitter.mp4), and [Instagram](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/.github/assets/instagram.mp4)).

This often comes down to props that update in reference, like callbacks or object values. For example, the `onClick` function and `style` object are re-created on every render, causing `ExpensiveComponent` to slow down the app:

```jsx
<ExpensiveComponent onClick={() => alert('hi')} style={{ color: 'purple' }} />
```

React Scan helps you identify these issues by automatically detecting and highlighting renders that cause performance issues. Now, instead of guessing, you can see exactly which components you need to fix.

### FAQ

**Q: Why this instead of React Devtools?**

React Devtools aims to be a general purpose tool for React. However, I deal with React performance issues every day, and React Devtools doesn't fix my problems well. There's a lot of noise (no obvious distinction between unnecessary and necessary renders), and there's no programmatic API. If it sounds like you have the same problems, then React Scan may be a better choice.

Also, some personal complaints about React Devtools' highlight feature:

- React Devtools "batches" paints, so if a component renders too fast, it will lag behind and only show 1 every second or so
- When you scroll/resize the boxes don't update position
- No count of how many renders there are
- I don't know what the bad/slow renders are without inspecting
- The menu is hidden away so it's annoying to turn on/off, user experience should be specifically tuned for debugging performance, instead of hidden behind a profiler/component tree
- No programmatic API
- It's stuck in a chrome extension, I want to run it anywhere on the web
- It looks subjectively ugly (lines look fuzzy, feels sluggish)
- I'm more ambitious with react-scan (see our roadmap)

**Q: React Native wen?**

Soon :)

**Q: Chrome Extension wen?**

Soon :)

## Roadmap

- [x] Scan only for unnecessary renders ("unstable" props)
- [x] Scan API (`withScan`, `scan`)
- [x] Cleanup config options
- [x] Chrome extension (h/t [@biw](https://github.com/biw))
- [x] Mode to highlight long tasks
- [x] Add context updates
- [x] Expose primitives / internals for advanced use cases
- [x] More explicit options override API (start log at certain area, stop log, etc.)
- [x] Don't show label if no reconciliation occurred ("client renders" in DevTools)
- [x] "global" counter using `sessionStorage`, aggregate count stats instead of immediate replacement
- [x] Give a general report of the app's performance
- [ ] checkbox filtering API, leaderboard
- [ ] Offscreen canvas on worker thread
- [x] heatmap decay (stacked renders will be more intense)
- [ ] Investigate components (UI allowlist)
- [ ] UI for turning on/off options
- [ ] “PageSpeed insights” for React
- [ ] React Native support
- [ ] Name / explain the actual problem, docs
- [ ] Simple FPS counter
- [ ] Drag and select areas of the screen to scan
- [ ] Long task progress bar filter
- [x] Report should include all renders
- [ ] [Runtime version guarding](https://github.com/lahmatiy/react-render-tracker/blob/229ad0e9c28853615300724d5dc86c140f250f60/src/publisher/react-integration/utils/getInternalReactConstants.ts#L28)
- [ ] React as peer dependency (lock version to range)
- [ ] Add a funny mascot, like the ["Stop I'm Changing" dude](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FwOZdX7bDKI?app=desktop)

## Acknowledgments

React Scan takes inspiration from the following projects:

- [React Devtools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) for the initial idea of [highlighting renders](https://medium.com/dev-proto/highlight-react-components-updates-1b2832f2ce48). We chose to diverge from this to provide a [better developer experience](https://x.com/aidenybai/status/1857122670929969551)
- [Million Lint](https://million.dev) for scanning and linting approaches
- [Why Did You Render?](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) for the concept of hijacking internals to detect unnecessary renders caused by "unstable" props
